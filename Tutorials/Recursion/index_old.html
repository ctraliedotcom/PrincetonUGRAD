<tr><td><a href="binary.html"><center>Intro to Number Systems</center></a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie</center></td><td><center>ACSL Math</td><td>This tutorial introduces some fundamental concepts, such as binary, that perpetually resurface all throughout the ACSL contest.  This is one of the most important precursor tutorials for later lessons as well, so be sure to look at it if you are new to any of the material.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="recursion.html"><b><center>Recursion</center></b></a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie</center></td>
<td><center>ACSL Math & Enrichment</center></td><td>Recursion is one of the topics on the first ACSL exam, and it also just so happens to be one of my favorite mathematical concepts.  To prepare for the ACSL exam, you only really need to look at the first subsection of this tutorial, which is really quite short.  However, I don't feel that the ACSL exam does recursion justice, so also created many subsections of this tutorial dealing with practical applications of recursion.  I am very proud of these sections, and I think that they help to have a deeper understanding of the concepts, so <b>I would highly recommend looking them over (<i>I also created some cool applets</i>)</b>.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="lisp.html"><center>LISP Programming (unfinished)</center></a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie</center></td>
<td><center>ACSL Programming</center></td><td>This tutorial is currently unfinished (it's a long one), but most of the vital information is there, so you can begin to read it as I continue to plug away here.  The tutorial explains how to get a free LISP interpreter up and running, and it explains all of the basics needed to write programs under this language.  Hopefully I'll be able to finish this tutorial by 11/12</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="Perl.doc"><center>Perl Programming</center></a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie</center></td><td><center>Enrichment Programming</center></td><td>Perl is a great, easy language to use for the ACSL contest.  I have often been able to condense ACSL programs to less than 30 lines with this language!  Instead of writing a full-blown tutorial on Perl (there are plenty of programming tutorials online), I made this tutorial a few years ago as a sort of "cram sheet" to accompany an introductory lesson on Perl.  It's a very succint Microsoft Word document with everything you need to get started.  To install Perl under a Windows environment, either download <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">Active Perl</a> or follow <a href="lisp.html#install">my instructions for installing Cygwin</a> with the Perl package.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="booleanalgebra.html"><center>Boolean Algebra</center></a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie</center></td>
<td><center>ACSL Math</center></td><td>Boolean algebra is one of the main focusses of the second ACSL contest.  I personally enjoy it very much, as it is all very logical and elegant, and is also important for explaining the behavior of digital circuits (as you will see later).</td></tr>


<tr><td><a href="../..//APCS" target="_blank"><center>Time Complexity, Searches, and Sorts</a></td><td><center>Chris Tralie and Andrew Burke</td><td><center>AP Computer Science Review</td><td>Andrew Burke and I wrote this tutorial together a couple of years ago as a review of some algorithms discussed in chapter 15 of <i>The Fundamentals of Java</i>.  It is a good review of some important topics pertaining to the AP computer science exam in Java.</td></tr>
