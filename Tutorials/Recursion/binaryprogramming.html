<p>As you now know, everything in a computer is stored as a series of 1s and 0s, and each binary digit is known as a <b>bit</b> for short (it takes too long to say "binary digit").  Unfortunately, there is only a finite amount of RAM and hard drive space, so we can't just assume that we have all of the bits that we need.  To keep track of all of the bits that we do have, we can use the SI prefixes.  In other words, a "megabit" is 10<SUP>6</SUP> (a million) bits, and a "gigabit" is 10<SUP>9</SUP> (a billion) bits.  We can also describe quantities in terms of a <b>byte</b>, which is eight bits (computer programmers are witty sometimes).  So if you have 256 megabytes of RAM, you actually have 2.048 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> little bit switches working to store everything you have loaded.  With this system, <i>each byte can be expressed as two hexadecimal digits.</i></p>

<p>In C++ and Java, some common data types and their size in bytes are as follows:

<table border="1" bgcolor="yellow"><tr><td><b>char</b></td><td><b>1 byte</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>short</td><td>1 byte</td></tr><tr><td>int</td><td>2 bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>4 bytes</td></tr><tr><td>double</td><td>4 bytes</td></tr></table>
