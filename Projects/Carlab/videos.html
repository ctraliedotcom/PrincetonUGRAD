For our final assignment for carlab, we were asked to create hardware and software that would allow our car to follow a line and to use that to complete a loop track. We also needed to have a finite state machine on board to report which section of the track the car was in. Carlton and I created a GUI in Java to visualize the estimate of the car's location as it drove around the track. The car updates its estimate of its position and sends that information back to our computer via wirless serial

One of our tasks during carlab was to create a car that could follow a line and to avoid a small obstacle in the way. The car needed to detect the obstacle with an IR distance sensor, report that it hit an obstacle through a wireless serial card, move around the obstacle, and find the line again.

We use the built-in microphone on our car to pick up sound through the ADC. We send that sound back to our computer and do an FFT real-time, and decide to steer in a particular direction based on the pitch of the note played on a piano
