<li><a href = "AllBeans.htm">All CodeWarrior beans</a> for configuring our hardware devices attached to the microprocessor<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "extrafeature1.htm">This entry</a> explains our first "extra feature," which made the robot turn its wheels based on what pitch someone played on a musical instrument (using the built-in microphone on the microprocessor)<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "extrafeature2.htm">This entry</a> explains our second "extra feature," which provided a visual for the finite state machine that said where the car was on the track<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "FSM-turning.htm">This entry</a> explains how we made the finite state machine that tracked turning<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "linedetection.htm">This entry</a> explains how we tweaked line detection using a C2 video camera<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "obstacleavoidance.htm">This entry</a> explains how we did obstacle avoidance using an IR sensor and a pre-programmed obstacle avoidance motion routine<BR><BR></li>
<li><a href = "speedcontrolbug.htm">This entry</a> explains how we fixed a bug in our PID speed control last minute that allowed us to have our robot move at a constant speed along the wrinkly track<BR><BR>

<li><a href = "wirelessbasestation.htm">This entry</a> explains how we set up a wireless base station on our laptop that allowed us to get debugging information much more quickly during crunch time<BR><BR></li>

<li><a href = "ZieglerNichols.htm">This entry</a> explains how we used the Ziegler Nichols algorithm and our wireless base station to tune our PID speed control</li>
