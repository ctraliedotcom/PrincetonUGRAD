<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>Speed
Control Bugs Discovered during Project 4</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>5/4/2010<br>
We discovered a few bugs that were causing the speed control to go haywire at
certain points.  Originally, we set up a special microsecond timer that had
double word precision to time the time between hall pulses on the wheel (used
for speed sensing).  We needed to do this because 1 second in microseconds is
10<sup>6</sup>, which is beyond the range of a 2-byte word on this
microprocessor.  To do this we created an overflow counter that counts 0.05
(twentieth) second intervals and had the regular counter that returned the rest
of the time as a word.  The microsecond timer was reset each time a new
twentieth of a second was counted.  So splitting it into twentieth second
intervals and resetting the counter, we get the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Courier New"'>word hallTime //The actual time read on the timer</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Courier New"'>word hall20thTime //The number of 20<sup>th</sup> seconds that
elapsed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Courier New"'>dword actualTime = hallTime / 100 + hall20thTime * 500 //The
time in “tenth milliseconds” (10 times finer resolution than a millisecond)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>There were
two bugs that came out of inconsistent use of this timer we set up:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When
     looking at the time between hall ticks, we calculated <b>dt</b> by
     returning the time in milliseconds from the clock (since we figured <b>dt</b>
     didn’t need to be as accurate).  But we forgot to count the 20<sup>th</sup>
     timer when we did this, so we were simply getting the spillover from the
     timer.  The consequence was that if, for example, there was a time of
     about 1/20<sup>th</sup> of a second between hall pulses, the program would
     think there was a time of roughly <b>0</b>, which meant that it thought it
     was going much much faster than it actually was.  Since dt was so small,
     this sometimes caused the duty cycle to be set to full, so the car would
     speed off extremely quickly at times due to this bug.  Once it was fixed
     this speeding off to infinity went away.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Timing
     reads only occur on hall tick negative edges.  To make sure that the car
     didn’t halt, we gave the dutyCycle a jolt to 0.25 every time 1 second
     elapsed without seeing any hall pulses.  What we also did after one second
     (which was a mistake) was completely reset the timer (20<sup>th</sup>
     seconds and actual timer).  This made it so that after the jolt when a
     hall pulse was seen again, a really small time would have been read since
     the timer was reset.  So if there was supposed to be 1.001 seconds between
     hall pulses after giving the jolt, the program would have seen only 0.001
     seconds and thought once again that it was going too fast.  This would
     lead to another jolt being given, and the car would sort of jolt forward
     slowly once per second if it got into this state.  So we were screwed
     whenever the car got slowed down enough that it missed pulses for a
     second, because it could never get out of it.  Resetting the timer every
     30 seconds (instead of every 1 second when we gave it the jolt) fixed this
     problem</span></li>
