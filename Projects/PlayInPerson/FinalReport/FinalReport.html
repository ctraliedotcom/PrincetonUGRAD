We started working on the project in the third week. I setup our project management software (e.g. svn and redmine) and then started working on the Java socket server while the other team members learned how to use the Flex framework. We came up with an ambitious plan in our project overview document, but over Spring break, we realized that we would have a lot of trouble proceeding with it. Originally, we planned to devote most of our efforts to the main interface and just have one person (Chris T) focus on a game or two. However, by the end of Spring break, we realized that the Flex learning curve was too difficult for everyone to overcome in order to contribute adequately to the project. I&#39;ll discuss the learning curve a bit more later, but after realizing that the learning curve was going to be a serious problem, we decided to change our plans to reduce the learning curve so that we would end up with more code and a better final product. Specifically, since I had the most experience with the Flex framework (though, I was still learning), we decided that I should code the main user interface, and that everyone else should work on games because Flex game programming has a smaller learning curve (mainly because it doesn&#39;t require as much experience with the Flex component life cycle or as much knowledge of the interaction between MXML and ActionScript). The plan was to work together on the interface between the games and the main interface and to discuss common challenges with game programming (as intended, we did this throughout the semester).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before changing the original plans, we intended to have a few extra features for the main interface like multiple chat rooms, private chat, a ranking system, an automatic filtering system for the chatroom, an admin system, and user profiles. We probably would have been able to accomplish this if everyone was working on the main interface and if everyone had already overcome the learning curve. However, after changing the plans, I was the only one working on the main interface, so some of these original goals became completely infeasible. However, I did manage to reach most of the goals I had hoped to accomplish after the original plan changed. I wanted to also implement private messaging, multiple chat rooms, and implement some sort of ranking system &ndash; I even designed the system so that these features would be easy to add in, but I didn&#39;t quite have enough time to implement them. Although we had serious problems with our original plans, we discovered them right away and changed the plans before the first weekly meeting. The goals I set for my part of the project after the initial change were slightly ambitious, but I managed to accomplish most of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">working with Flex</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s relatively easy to use the Flex framework to quickly design a simple application in which all the code can fit in one large file. However, for medium-large scale rich Internet applications (RIAs), it becomes necessary to divide the project into a large number of independent components; otherwise, the code base turns into an unmaintainable mess. Unfortunately, there is a very steep learning curve when transitioning from simple Flex applications to medium-large scale ones mostly because of the complex Flex component life cycle, the event system, and the often non-intuitive interaction between MXML and Action Script. I was still trying to overcome this learning curve when I started working on the main interface. As a result, some of the first code I wrote for the interface was unmaintainable and messy, so I ended up having to re-write portions of the interface a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I eventually overcame this learning curve, and I think that the final structure and code of the main interface is clean and maintainable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular design pattern, the &ldquo;code-behind&rdquo; pattern, helped me to better manage code in the main interface by separating the visual MXML language in a component from the ActionScript logic into separate files. I found this particularly useful for large files that had significant portions written in both MXML and ActionScript (e.g. the main PlayInPerson module). However, I initially attempted to use this pattern for every module that required both MXML and ActionScript. Although I like the idea of separating MXML and ActionScript into separate files, the code-behind pattern has a slight overhead in terms of complexity that can lead to slower development in some modules (we&#39;ll discuss this more later). If I were to start from the beginning, I would be more careful about which modules to use the code-behind pattern for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Flex has a built-in debugger, it can only run on one instance at a time, so it was sometimes difficult to use it to test features that involve multiple users. So, in order to facilitate debugging the main interface, I wrote a function to replace the built in trace (a function that outputs to the debug window). The new function I wrote, tr, outputs to a custom debug window that I made that appears on each individual instance of the main interface. This method of debugging worked very well. At first, I also found it frustrating to debug certain parts of the interface like the game room because viewing the game room requires logging into the website and starting up a game. In order to get around this, I wrote a custom loader to load an instance of a game room immediately without requiring logging in. This wasn&#39;t overly difficult, but it wasn&#39;t as trivial as it sounds. The main lesson I learned here was that you can save time in the long run by spending some time up front setting up debug tools.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main unpleasant surprises I encountered with Flex involves cross-domain policy files. Before Flash Player can send a request to a script or connect to a socket server, it must access a policy file on that server to make sure that the client is authorized to connect or send a request. While such mechanisms are necessary to protect against cross-site scripting attacks (e.g. a rogue Flex script could otherwise send a request to a user&#39;s bank account page if he had previously logged in), it can be frustrating to work with the mechanism. For example, in order to allow Flash Player to connect to a socket server, it must first connect to a cross-domain policy socket server on the same host that serves a cross-domain policy file on request. Setting up this additional server was a nuisance, but even worse, Flash Player imposes that the socket server must listen on port 843, a protected port. Therefore, the server must either be run as root, or port 843 must be routed to a higher, non protected port. For security reasons, it&#39;s considered bad practice to run such servers as root, so I had to setup ip tables to route 843 to another port.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">authentication system</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most interesting challenges I faced during the semester was designing the authentication system. Looking back, I think I spent too much time trying to find a pre-existing system to use for the website; I was overly concerned with not re-inventing the wheel (or not re-inventing an inferior wheel). Unfortunately, I never found a good authentication system that could be easily adapted to our architecture (most of the authentication systems I found weren&#39;t designed for authentication over a socket server). Therefore, after giving up on finding an existing system, I had to design my own. Perhaps the most difficult part of the whole process was settling on a final design; the main problem was that I had so many designs in mind that I had trouble deciding between them. I eventually made up my mind by determining the most important properties for our authentication system and selecting the design that best satisfied those properties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our site is mainly geared towards entertainment and doesn&#39;t rely on any sort of monetary exchange, the consequences of an attacker breaking into another user&#39;s account aren&#39;t nearly as severe as they would be on a banking site. However, users often use the same passwords on multiple sites, so if an attacker were to acquire a user&#39;s password on our site, then he could use it on another site. Therefore, I decided that the most important property for our system was to make it very difficult for an attacker to acquire another user&#39;s original password. To meet this design goal, I decided that passwords should never be sent in plain text and that the server should never even see the original plain text passwords. Unfortunately, never sending a password in plain text isn&#39;t as easy as simply configuring Apache for https because the password needs to be sent to the socket server. However, it can be accomplished by encrypting the password on the client side before sending it over to the server. While this gives the client&#39;s original password some protection, encrypting the password on the client side is essentially just changing the password that&#39;s used to log into the Play In Person system; therefore, the encrypted password also needs to be protected. I accomplished this be implementing a challenge response system for logging into the sock server (see the design document for more details). The register.php should be protected by https, but I didn&#39;t have time to set this up on apache (and didn&#39;t really see it as necessary for the purposes of this project).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned two important lessons from designing the authentication system. First, when I&#39;m trying to decide between implementing a system from scratch and using an existing system, I need to be more aware of how much time I&#39;m spending doing research (and perhaps explicitly keep track of how much time I&#39;m spending). Second, when I&#39;m trying to decide between multiple designs, I should make a prioritized list of desired features to help me pick a final design. These two lessons will probably save me time on future projects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">socket server</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there was a bit of a learning curve for Apache Mina (the framework I used for writing the socket server), I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked and how easy it was to use (after overcoming the learning curve). I had previous experience coding network applications in C, and I remember it being a nightmare, so I expected the worst when I started working on the server; but, things turned out to be much easier with Apache Mina and Java.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Chris Tralie&#39;s Final Report</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Chris K mentioned, I was originally designated as the primary game-maker on the team, since I&rsquo;ve had a lot of experience with computer graphics and game-making in general for many different genres of games, especially 2D. &nbsp;My first task in the project was to create a multiplayer Tetris game, as Tetris is one of my favorite games and I had written a Tetris game before in Java Swing. &nbsp;This was my trial-by-fire introduction to graphics programming in Adobe Flex right before spring break. &nbsp;I learned how to draw 2D graphics onto an mx:canvas object, and the Tetris game just turned into a bunch of rectangles that were drawn on top of each other each time the screen was (often) refreshed. &nbsp;I managed to implement rotation and motion of 7 different pieces by creating a piece lookup table, which had entries for each rotation of each type of piece. &nbsp;I also got keyboard control to work after a bit of struggle, which I documented on Redmine (basically I was having a hard time locking focus on the mx:canvas component).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tetris did not end up panning out for several reasons, though. &nbsp;After I fixed the initial bugs in the system, I noticed that the game was slowing down </span><span class="c2 c4">significantly</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;after just a few pieces dropped down. &nbsp;With Chris K&rsquo;s help, I eventually did some profiling and found out that redrawing the canvas was excruciatingly slow, since I redrew every rectangle every time. &nbsp;I eventually realized that since a lot of the Flex 2D graphics work in software, a real-time game developer needs to treat repainting to a buffer as a very costly operation. &nbsp;Copying large regions of pixels from buffer to buffer is fast, but redrawing individual pixels from scratch like I was doing was extremely slow, especially given how many times I would do it. &nbsp;So a much better design practice in Flex is to buffer things and only redraw when absolutely necessary. &nbsp;So in this case I should have pre-drawn all possible pieces in all of their different orientations and saved them in buffers, to be copied on top of a background that was pre-drawn. &nbsp;In other words, I would have done the (costly) drawing once and saved it for re-use later. &nbsp;However, I never got around to doing this because after some investigation, Chris K and I found out that the Tetris company holds a monopoly over all Tetris games, and we probably would have gotten the pants sued off of us if we had been in any way successful without a license. &nbsp;But an important lesson about efficiency was learned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With the (educational) failure of Tetris, Chris K and I decided that the best direction for me to take my work would be in developing Poker, which was believe to be the Killer App for our platform (because of poker faces). &nbsp;So I went back to the drawing board with Flex and spent a lot of time learning how to deal with flex bitmap buffers (in addition to reviewing poker rules). &nbsp;I then wrote a simple application to draw cards of arbitrary sizes to practice some of the buffering techniques I&rsquo;d learned. &nbsp;I took the image that GNOME uses in its desktop cards games:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7 c12"><a class="c5" href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c12/cards.png">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c12/cards.png</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">and I cropped out which cards I wanted to display. &nbsp;This was the beginning of the client-side GUI development. &nbsp;I made this code available to the group so that Minqi and Zane could use it as a model when starting their games.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before I could make much more progress in the gameplay, I needed to start developing the server so I could implement some rules. &nbsp;As I mentioned in the design document, the system was designed so that all rules and state information was stored on the server side (for security reasons and to prevent cheating), so I really needed to make more progress there first. &nbsp;I worked with Chris to set up a test environment where I could run a fake server on my computer, and it worked out so that we could quickly deploy any modules that I was developing in that environment. &nbsp;Then it was just a matter of looking up the rules of poker and implementing them on the server side. &nbsp;I carefully created parallel code on the Flex client and server side to store player and game state. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time dealing with corner cases (e.g. players standing up in the middle of a round) that I don&rsquo;t have time to talk about in any of these reports, but corner cases took up at least half of my development time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the Flex client codebase grew larger, I had to adapt the code-behind pattern that Chris K alluded to. &nbsp;I thought this would be an obstacle at first, because it didn&rsquo;t seem very intuitive, but it ended up working out extremely well. &nbsp;I basically just had to adapt a new style of thinking; to view my ActionScript as a superclass that has defined all of the objects I want to be able to deal with code-wise in the actionscript code, and the MXML file a subclass that extends those objects and lays them out in a particular way. &nbsp;Being able to design the GUI in the MXML file by clicking the mouse and dragging buttons around streamlined the GUI development process significantly for me. &nbsp;I feel that I could have done a better job artistically but that&rsquo;s not my strong suit. &nbsp;I would probably need a professional eye to help me with art and layout. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Overall, I was able to implement all of the features of poker that I set out to implement, except for putting the webcam feed of each player next to their cards. &nbsp;To address this in the future, I would probably draw a red box around of the camera of the player whose turn it is over to the side (to make it more clear whose turn it is), instead of trying to cram it onto the board. &nbsp;As far as features that I didn&rsquo;t mention but would be neat, I would like to implement a blinds schedule so that the blinds increase the longer people are in the game, and I would probably change the system so that players take money with them when they stand up instead of leaving money on the table for the next person who sits down to resume.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Minqi&#39;s Final Report</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Throughout the course of this project, I have contributed to various parts of the project, including designing the current PlayInPerson logo and bug-tracking and feature testing. &nbsp;However, my main contribution to PlayInPerson has been developing the Game of Set. &nbsp;Set is a semi-obscure, though highly engrossing card game that has somewhat of a cult following in places like math an science camps. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chris K and I discussed initial milestones regarding my contributions to the PlayInPerson project. &nbsp;It was decided that I would develop the Game of Set for around 3 weeks and then spend the rest of the semester developing a crosswords application. &nbsp;However, game development proved much more time intensive than previously envisioned. &nbsp;Many unforeseen issues made way to important design challenges that had to be overcome. &nbsp;For example, implementing the actual game rules of Set was not difficult, but synchronizing the random decks amongst several players was significantly more challenging. &nbsp;A somewhat complex message-passing protocol had to be created to handle communication between the multiple players in the same Set game room. &nbsp;Furthermore, issues such as synchronizing players who are invited to play Set in mid-game had to be overcome. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I worked with Chris K to design a message passing system for communicating changes in game state across Set instances. &nbsp;Implementing this message relaying between player instances of Set bridged the gap between the client code and the server code. &nbsp;A client-server game interface was developed for use specifically for passing messages from between client and server. &nbsp;Ultimately, this message passing is what allows for the game to be multiplayer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the PlayInPerson server is currently a mere personal desktop computer, connection latency is an issue, impacting game performance. &nbsp;As Set, along with the other games developed for PlayInPerson, relies heavily on message passing, delayed messages can result in significant problems in the continuity of game play. &nbsp;For example, consider what happens when two players both find the same set of 3 cards. &nbsp;If player A finds the set first, but player B finds the set before player A&#39;s Set instance can send the update message to the server, and before the server can forward the message to player B, both players will gain 3 points for successfully finding the same set. &nbsp;In fact, allowing for this duplicate set discovery ultimately became the way we solved this issue. &nbsp;Chris K and I also entertained the idea of only allowing the chronologically first discoverer of the set to claim the set, but we decided against this design choice, as such a system could introduce choppy game play. &nbsp;Just imagine selecting the 3 cards of a set you had spent all this time finding only to be informed by a message box that the set you had so joyfully spotted was already taken by the opponent. &nbsp;However, once PlayInPerson moves to more powerful servers such as Amazon Web Services, latency will be less of an issue and hopefully a more real time solution of the simultaneous set find issue may be explored. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The nuances of Flex programming--finding the right balance between ActionScript and MXML in development and the lack of sophisticated bug-tracking features--resulted in a much more challenging development experience than previously imagined. &nbsp;However, after some weeks of working with Flex code and tinkering with Adobe Flash Builder, I eventually began to get the hang of the work flow. &nbsp;The event-based programming style of Flex &nbsp;began to make more sense, and progress on Set accelerated. Ultimately, the current version of Set functions quite well. &nbsp;The game graphics look appealing and, judging from personal experience in showing the game to friends and other acquaintances, the game seems to be quite addicting and enjoyable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With more time, the current implementation of Set could be improved by adding additional features such as an automatic Set finder that could be used when a player is stuck or to verify if all Sets have been found. &nbsp;Further, animating the last 3 cards taken as a Set would be useful in allowing players to better gauge the past actions of other players. &nbsp;Lastly, with more time, I would have looked more into games that more holistically integrate with the video-feed of PlayInPerson. &nbsp;Games like charades, variants of Pictionary, and a staring contest game using a simple object recognition algorithm could prove to be incredibly fun and unlike anything currently on the Internet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Despite my initial unfamiliarity with the Adobe Flex SDK and ActionScript, the experience of building PlayInPerson made me quite proficient in these development tools. &nbsp;Event-based game programming has been an enjoyable experience, giving plenty of opportunities to explore good GUI design, issues of interactivity in multi-user applications, and challenges in network programming. &nbsp;However, I found debugging Flex code to be difficult. &nbsp;Run time errors were not reported, and instead as a developer, I had to feel my way around the code in order to gain a sense of what portion of the program the error might have occurred in. &nbsp;However, on the other hand, such austere debugging experiences with Flash Builder have made be a better debugger and has forced me to write well commented and clearly organized code. &nbsp;Further, the experience of developing a large project with a other highly motivated programmers has been a great learning experience in coding style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Zane&#39;s Final Report</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My main contributions to the project were creating 1) Tic-Tac-Toe and 2) Bomberman. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I also worked on the chat user-menu, which features the player username and invite button, during Spring Break. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">1) Progamming Tic-Tac-Toe as our first game served two functions. The first function was to provide a proof-of-concept game that we could implement for the alpha version of our website. It took me two weeks to code all of the graphical and logical aspects of the game, in the form of a single-client version of Tic-Tac-Toe, where 2 players could play on a single computer. In the second week after Spring Break, I worked with Chris K to figure out the messaging system/protocol between separate game instances, and I finished the multiplayer version of Tic-Tac-Toe. We managed to implement the fully working version for the alpha version of our website. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The second function of programming Tic-Tac-Toe &nbsp;was to help me overcome the learning curve for Adobe Flex. Coming into the project, I had previous experience with HTML, which is vaguely related to MXML, and I had previous experience with Java, which is similar to Actionscript. For me, the difficulty of learning Flex lay in getting used to the balance between Actionscript and MXML. I had to adapt the mindset described by Chris T. While it is possible to code everything in Actionscript, MXML is useful as a veiled, mark-up version of Actionscript that nicely handles the display of visual Actionscript objects.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the process of programming Tic-Tac-Toe, I learned some fundamental aspects of GUI design and 2D-gaming, both of which I had little experience in. Flex utilizes a visual display list, which is based on a parent-child tree-type hierarchy. In order to display visual elements in Flex, the visual object must be added to the display list. This style of visual display management affords simple control of visual element stacking, i.e. displaying a button on top of a background canvas or other display. Secondly, the visual display list is designed to work well with event handling in Flex. I learned about Flex event propagation through the visual display list; in specific, utilizing the capture and bubbling phases of event propagation proved extremely useful for game interaction and communication between Flex objects. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The basic framework of the game was designed modularly so that it could be re-used for other simple grid-based games such as Connect Four or Bejeweled or Scrabble. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The second game that I worked on for the last 4 weeks of the semester is Bomberman. Programming Bomberman also went through a steep learning curve because of the live-action aspect of the game. I learned the timing and execution of underlying Flex/Actionscript commands and processes (such as the lack of threading in Flex) in order to best design the Bomberman game. Initial design of the game was affected by several factors:</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;1) limited server traffic-handling capability. To address this issue, we decided not to implement a separate game server that houses the game logic; instead, we decided to host the game logic completely on the client-side, and only use the server to relay messages between different client game instances. The primary advantage to this approach is conserving server-side resources, making the games more autonomous and less connectivity-dependent. However, there are some significant disadvantages as well, including cheating and game-synchronization issues. To address the issue of synchronization, I update animation frames by absolute position and execute a series of request-response check messages for significant game events. </span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2">2) Chris T&rsquo;s experience with slow image re-drawing for Tetris. To minimize the amount of redrawing that needed to be done with Bomberman, I essentially handled all of the graphics at the lowest-level possible to reduce the program overhead and only redraw the necessary elements. To display graphics, I used the &nbsp;BitmapData data type, which is essentially a matrix of pixel colors to be used. Additionally, in my implementation only non-static objects in the game, i.e. bombs, bombers, and explosions, are drawn on top of the background grid. This enables minimal redrawing during animation; only moving objects get redrawn. I also worked on balancing the refresh rate with the movement step-size that would reduce the number redrawing operations while still presenting visually acceptable animation. This low-level control and bare-bones approach led to sufficiently fast graphics animation.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2">One major issue that I encountered was with initial message sending between game instances. Sometimes the messages would go through, but other times they wouldn&rsquo;t. I worked together with Chris K to resolve the issue by allowing the game modules to load to completion before depolying any client-client messages. This workaround should be useful in the development of all future games.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2">Because of the open-endedness of an action game that is completely controlled by the player, I had many, many special cases and little nuances for the game that I had to test and account for. Given more time, I would continue to fix minor bugs (the game sometimes causes a warning on Windows machines and I have been testing exclusively on a Mac). In the future, I would definitely like to implement a version of the game in which you can collect power-ups, such as increased speed, increased bomb count, and increased bomb size. Some underlying code intended for such functionality can be found within the Bomb and Bomber classes. Also, a team-play mode would further incentivize competitive game play, which I think is the strong suit of the Bomberman game. </span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">If we had more time...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to meet many of the milestones that we set out for ourselves this semester. &nbsp;We certainly at least had a proof-of-concept interface along with a few very convincing games. &nbsp;However, there are a few direct extensions that could be made from our current setup to improve the system, and there are some more far-reaching ideas we have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as a few short-term incremental improvements go, we would like to create multiple chatrooms instead of one main chatroom so that for a large user base, it is easier to navigate and find the kind of people you want to talk to. &nbsp;We could start out with a few chatrooms hard-wired in, such as a &ldquo;Texas Hold&rsquo;Em Masters Room,&rdquo; and we could leave it up to the users to set up the rest of these sub-chatrooms. &nbsp;We should also add some basic search capabilities to search through users in case there are many. &nbsp;Going along with all of this, we should switch the server over to Amazon Web Services as soon as possible to deal with a higher volume of users.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of users increases, we should also have more moderation capabilities to deal with potentially abusive users. &nbsp;This is always a tricky issue, but we could allow some sort of a voting system within games where people can vote to kick someone out, for example. &nbsp;And we can also establish a few trusted superusers in the system who have the power to kick people off, etc.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A longer-term goal for our system would be to begin to track user statistics from different games, and to create a sort of ladder system for the games. &nbsp;That is, as users play more and win more games, the system should log statistics on their win/loss record and be able to automatically pair them up with players of a similar playing ability. &nbsp;This could be a very interesting (and complicated) area of algorithmic development for our system, and it could make gameplay much more fun and competitive. &nbsp;We would still maintain the capability of users to set up custom games with people of varying playing abilities, but there would be the additional option of automatic pairing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as implementing more games goes, two that come immediately to mind are Mancala and crosswords. &nbsp;We believe that the game Mancala is in the public domain, and that it would be a neat puzzle game to play online. &nbsp;We also think that doing crossword puzzles, either in collaboration or competitively, as if you were &ldquo;in person&rdquo; would be a unique online experience. &nbsp;We also discussed creating games that incorporate the webcam directly, such as a &ldquo;staring contest.&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
