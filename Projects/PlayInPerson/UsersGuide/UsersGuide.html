to engage in a game of Set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Set, there is a deck of 81 cards. &nbsp;Each card has between 1 to 3 copies of the same symbol. &nbsp;There are 27 symbols, satisfying all possible combinations of shape, color, and fill, each attribute having 3 possible values. &nbsp;Treating the number of symbols as its own attribute, each card may be defined by a unique combination of values of four attributes:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Number: 1, 2, or 3.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shape: Oval, stadium, or squiggle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Color: Red, green, or blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fill: Empty, filled, or lines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each of the four attributes takes on 3 possible values, resulting in 3^4 Set cards. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The objective of Set is to find a sets of 3 cards such that among the three cards, each attribute is either all the same or all different. &nbsp;For example the following 3 cards comprise a valid set because among all 3 cards, the shape and numbers are the same while the number and fill are all different. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Game of Set begins with a randomly shuffled deck and 21 cards from the deck in play, which is provably the minimum number required to guarantee the presence of a valid set. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A player selects sets of 3 cards by clicking the corresponding cards. &nbsp;If the selected 3 cards indeed comprise a valid set, the 3 cards are removed from play and replaced by cards from the top of the deck if there are cards left in the deck. &nbsp;The player gains 3 points for each valid set found. &nbsp;A game of Set ends when the deck runs out of cards, and all remaining valid sets have been found. &nbsp;The player who finds the most sets and hence has the highest score by the time the deck runs out of cards wins the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once the game ends, to begin a new game, click the icon of the Set deck to reshuffle the deck and deal out 21 new cards. &nbsp;The game then commences as before. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span

class="c0"><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Texas Hold&rsquo;em Poker is a traditional casino card game in which players place bets against each other&rsquo;s dealt hands. &nbsp;PlayInPerson currently allows for up to 6 players to engage in a game of Texas Hold&rsquo;em. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The player who creates the room is the game administrator, responsible for controlling the game flow (deciding when to start the game once enough people have joined the game room, and when to reset the game). &nbsp;The administrator has access to his or her administrative options via the drop-down menu at the right of the game display. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before a game of Texas Hold&rsquo;em starts, each player selects a seat around the card table in the game interface. &nbsp;A player may also choose to stand and spectate the game at any time by clicking the button corresponding to the seat around the card table. &nbsp;Even though there are only 6 spots for actual players, an unlimited amount of spectators can exist. &nbsp;Once everyone is seated in the spots they want, the game administrator can start the game. &nbsp;Users can still sit and stand once the game has started, and this is dealt with gracefully, but we expect most people not to do this as often as they would before the game starts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Initially, each player starts with $5000 in poker chips. &nbsp;At the beginning of each round of betting, each player is dealt two cards from the shuffled deck. &nbsp;A round of betting follows, in which players put money into the community &ldquo;pot&rdquo; in the center of the table. &nbsp;In each round, the game cycles through all players and allows them to take action. &nbsp;When it&rsquo;s a player&rsquo;s turn, he/she can fold (leave the round and sacrifice any money he/she has bet), call (put in money to match the current bid in the pot), check (do nothing in the event that the money they&rsquo;ve put in matches the current bit already), raise (put in more money to face other players to call), or go all in (put in all of their money into the pot). &nbsp;In subsequent stages of betting in a round, additional cards will be dealt onto the card table that are visible to all players. &nbsp;A player must create the best hand possible of at most 5 cards out of his or her two initially dealt cards and the cards on the card table. &nbsp;For each pot, there are four rounds of betting (in which all players are cycled through until the players left in the game all match the money in the pot). &nbsp;After all rounds of betting, the player with the best hand wins the pot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here are a few more specific details about how betting works. &nbsp;In each round of betting, turns proceed clockwise from the designated &ldquo;Big Blind&rdquo; player, who is required to place an amount of chips equal to the blind ($100) into that round&rsquo;s pot (amount of chips the winner receives). &nbsp;The &ldquo;Small Blind&rdquo; player directly before the &ldquo;Big Blind&rdquo; player must place half of the blind ($50) into the pot. &nbsp;The blinds act as the initial bet for the round. &nbsp;At each player&rsquo;s turn, he or she must first call the current bet for that round, and has the option to raise the current bet. &nbsp;After every player has placed his or her bets, the players who have not matched the current bet are given a chance to call the bet or to fold their hand. &nbsp;Betting continues without new cards being turned over as long as people continue to raise. &nbsp;Note also that the &ldquo;Big Blind&rdquo; and &ldquo;Small Blind&rdquo; player shift one player clockwise with each subsequent pot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this initially round of betting, a set of 3 cards called &ldquo;the flop&rdquo; is dealt onto the table from the top of the deck, then an additional card called &ldquo;the turn&rdquo; is dealt, followed by a final card from the top of the deck called &ldquo;the river.&rdquo; &nbsp;A round of betting follows immediately after &ldquo;the flop,&rdquo; &ldquo;the turn,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;river.&rdquo; &nbsp;The same rules of betting follow after each of the flop, the turn, and the river.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once the final betting has completed, players turn over their cards and a winner is determined. &nbsp;The winner usually takes all of the money in the pot, except in some special cases that result in a &ldquo;split pot&rdquo; between several players (the winner went all in and only gets the money that matched that bet, or there were ties). &nbsp;These rules are a bit complicated and not worth delving into too much detail here, but the game deals with these cases correctly as far as we know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of each round, the players who are still in the game must confirm that they are ready to move onto the next round and to be dealt new cards by clicking the &ldquo;ready for next round&rdquo; button. &nbsp;This is to give players a chance to view the cards that opponents have to understand why a certain player won, before the cards get put away and reshuffled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A player loses Texas Hold&rsquo;em once he or she has lost all of his or her chips, but may sit down at another spot that still has chips left. &nbsp;The game is over as soon as there&rsquo;s only one person sitting who still has money, with said person winning the game.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One more thing to note is that each player can only see his/her two cards, except in some special circumstances, such as when a player goes all in and has no more money to put in (he/she has to show his/her cards as soon as the betting comes back around and he/she doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to call the current bid value). &nbsp;A player is not required to show his/her cards if he/she is the only one left in the round and everyone else folds. &nbsp;But players who stay in a round must always show their cards at the end of a round to determine who is the winner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The list of possible card hands

class="c1">In the game of Bomberman, users control animated sprites that may move around a grid space filled with block obstacles using the arrow keys of the keyboard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Players may command their sprites to drop &ldquo;bombs&rdquo; at the sprite&rsquo;s current location by pressing the space bar. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dropped bombs detonate after 5 seconds, and any other player whose sprite is within the blast radius of the bomb will be &ldquo;killed,&rdquo; including the player who dropped the bomb. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The explosion emitted by a bomb cannot travel past the block obstacles. &nbsp;Hiding behind a block obstacle is an effective means to evade a bomb blast, the other alternative being to run away quickly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon dropping a bomb, player gains 1 point for every other player eliminated by the bomb. &nbsp;If the player is accidentally eliminated by his or her own bomb, he or she loses 1 point. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once eliminated by a bomb, a player may rejuvenate their sprite,
