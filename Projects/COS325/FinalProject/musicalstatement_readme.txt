Put your headphones on for this one!  You'll need both channels to fully appreciate this


I started with The Jacksons' classic song "Can You Feel It"
The reason I chose this song is because it has extensive vamping, and it's disco style, meaning that the noise level will be relatively constant.  This allows me to show off the directional features with my program without any side variables interfering with the intensity of the sound (like changes in the loudness of the song).


So I just moved around the room and did the impulse responses over and over again, so it looks and sounds like I'm moving through a 3D hallway with a boombox playing



NOTE: Unfortunately, there is some noise with the method that I'm using, but the basics of reverberation and binaural position sensing aren't affected too adversely
