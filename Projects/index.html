<td><BR>For my final project in COS 451: Computational Geometry, I created a program in C++/OpenGL that, given two simple (non self-intersecting with no holes) polygons with the same area, can cut the first one into a finite number of pieces and arrange those pieces to form the second one.  Due to the chaos of graduation, I was unable to create a detailed report or to put the code in a form that is presentable here, so this is just acting as a placeholder for now (the picture to the left is a little tease of my program in action).  But I consider this to be one of the most interesting and challenging projects I've ever done at Princeton, and I plan to turn this into a detailed tutorial with an interactive Java applet on my upcoming Duke web site for graduate school!<BR><BR></td>

For our final project in <b>COS 333: Advanced Programming Techniques</b>, we created a web site with <a href = "http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex</a> that allows anonymous and registered video chat and gaming.  We wanted to create a site that is a hybrid between ChatRoulette and Yahoo! Games.  During the semester, we implemented a basic chat interface and four games that can be played with inline video chat: Tic Tac Toe, <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28game%29">Set</a>, Texas Hold'Em Poker, and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman">Bomberman</a>.

The purpose of this project was to implement a fully-featured and physically accurate (to the extent possible) acoustic simultation for determining the impulse response in arbitrary virtual environments.  This is a significant improvement over my previous attempt to do this in COS 325.  It can model all specular reflections with 100% accuracy up to a certain order using image sources.  We also implemented an approximation of diffraction and transmission, and we even implemented frequency-dependent reflection and transmission coefficients.<BR>

This has many applications, such as in photo tourism where objects in a city could be labeled for the user.  My main work this semester expands classification techniques of these segmented point clouds by adding a novel 3D shape descriptor.  The descriptor is based on aligning these point clouds to known models of city objects in a database<BR>
