Software Environment:
Fresh install of Ubuntu 9.04 32-bit

Our software repository:

1) Prepare a USB key with the Ubuntu installer on it by booting first from the Ubuntu install cd, and then running the "usb-creator" program
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick

2) When the netbook starts up, press F2 to access the BIOS.  Under the "Boot" menu, disable "Boot Booster."  This was a necessary step before replacing ram and putting on a new operating system

3) Save changes and shut down computer.  Insert USB key with Ubuntu install.  Power computer on and hold down "Esc" to boot from the USB key, then follow the install instructions

4) In Synaptic Package Manager under Settings->Repositories
Check off everything under Third Party Software.  Then click "Reload" in the main GUI

Install the following packages in synaptic package manager:
*ssh (for administering computer remotely...will install both client and server and start server automatically)
*x11vnc (for launching x applications remotely...tunnel through ssh)

5) Go to playerstage.sourceforge.net and download the most recent major releases of player and stage.  As of writing this tutorial, they are player 2.1.2 and stage 2.1.1, released on January 15, 2009 and January 16, 2009, respectively

6) Open up the file "~/.bashrc" for editing
Add the following lines at the top:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=/usr/local/include:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/gearbox/:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/gearbox/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Do the same thing for /etc/bash.bashrc

Then relaunch the terminal

7) Extract the player-2.1.2.tar.gz file and cd into it
Type "./configure --enable-rtkgui"
(the rtkgui is needed for the AMCL debugging GUI)

Then type "sudo make install"

8) Next extract the stage-2.1.1.tar.gz file, and CD into it
type "./configure"
type "sudo make install"

----------------------------------

9) Next, check out the code from our google code repository:
http://code.google.com/p/hospirfidbot

10) Next, create a file called "kdesvn.sh" in the directory ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/kdesvn.sh

that contains the code
#!/bin/sh/
kdesvn $1

This will allow for easy commits and updates to/from subversion
