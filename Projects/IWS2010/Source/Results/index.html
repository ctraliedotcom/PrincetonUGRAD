<p>
I ran 10 batch tests giving alignment scores for the 1161 blobs against the 42 meshes.  I then created an ARFF file for each test.  The order of the blobs tested is presented from top to bottom in <a href = "blobs.txt">this file</a>.  They were tested against all of the meshes in the order presented in <a href = "meshes.txt">this file</a>.
</p>

<p>
The name of the arff file indicates what type of batch test was run.  In each test, I sampled a maximum of 100 points from the point cloud and did ICP alignment to each of the 42 mesh models with that subset.  Then I chose an cutoff epsilon to say whether the aligned points were close enough to the mesh (the ratio of close enough points is the score), and I chose to do either 6D or 3D.  For example, take the arff file <b>test100_0.200.arff</b>.  This file means that 6D alignment was done with a cutoff epsilon of 0.2 meters.  The file <b>test100_3D_0.050.arff</b> means that 3D alignment was done with a cutoff epsilon of 0.05 meters.

Once I generated an ARFF file, I did Naive Bayes using Weka and got the probability matrix for classification.  I stored this probability matrix in a text file, and I created precision recall graphs from it.  This process is described in more detail <a href = "../index.html#precisionrecall">here</a>.
